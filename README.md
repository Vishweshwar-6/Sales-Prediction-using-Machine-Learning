# Sales-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
 A Comparative Study of Linear Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, and Gradient Boosting

# Project Overview
 This project aims to predict sales using multiple machine learning algorithms, including Linear Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, and Gradient Boosting. The goal is to evaluate the performance of these algorithms and choose the best one for accurate sales forecasting.

# Project Structure
 The project consists of the following files:

 Sales Data: The dataset used for training and testing the models.
 Sales-prediction Project.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing the Python code for sales prediction.
 Project Report.docx: A detailed report covering the project background, methodology, model performance, and conclusions.
 Sales Prediction.pptx: A PowerPoint presentation summarizing the project's key aspects and results.

# Requirements
 Make sure to install the following dependencies to run the code:
  - **numpy**
  - **pandas**
  - **scikit-learn**
  - **matplotlib**
  - **seaborn**

# Machine Learning Models Used
 I have implemented and compared the following machine learning algorithms:

 - **Linear Regression**
 - **Random Forest**
 - **Decision Tree**
 - **Gradient Boosting**

# Evaluation Metrics:
 # Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): Measures the average squared difference between actual and predicted values.
